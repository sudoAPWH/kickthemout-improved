# Installation

## Debian Installation

**NOTE**
After most linux distros/Mac implemented PEP 668, you can no longer use **pip** to install system-wide python dependencies without a virtual environment. For most distros you will need to install the dependencies through your package manager using a command like this: ``` sudo apt install python3-packagename ``` 

You can download kickthemout by using the setup.sh, or cloning the repo:

**IF USING THE SETEUP.SH (Debian Systems ONLY) Follow the instructions below:**
```
1. create the setup.sh shell script by copying its contents from this repo.
2. ❯❯❯ chmod +x setup.sh
3. ❯❯❯ ./setup.sh
```
4. The script will clone the repo, install needed dependencies, and run kickthemout for the first time!


**DEBIAN MANUAL INSTALL INSTRUCTIONS BELOW:**


```
~ ❯❯❯ sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install nmap

~ ❯❯❯ sudo apt install python3-nmap && sudo apt install python3-scapy && sudo apt install python3-netifaces

~ ❯❯❯ git clone https://github.com/k4m4/kickthemout.git

~ ❯❯❯ cd kickthemout/

~/kickthemout ❯❯❯ sudo python3 kickthemout.py
```


## MacOS Installation

If you would like to install KickThemOut on a Mac, please run the following: **NOTE: You will need a virtual environment on mac**

```
~ ❯❯❯ brew install libdnet nmap

~ ❯❯❯ git clone https://github.com/k4m4/kickthemout.git

~ ❯❯❯ cd kickthemout/

~/kickthemout ❯❯❯ sudo -H pip3 install -r requirements.txt 

~/kickthemout ❯❯❯ sudo python3 kickthemout.py

```

**NOTE**: You need to have [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) installed before running the Mac OS installation. 

Also, **keep in mind** that you might be asked to run some extra commands after executing the pip requirement installation.


## ArchLinux Installation

You can download KickThemOut on an Arch based system by executing the following: 

**NOTE: You will need a virtual environment to use pip, unless you install the python dependencies through the AUR as PACMAN does not currently have the needed dependencies**

```
~ ❯❯❯ git clone https://github.com/k4m4/kickthemout.git

~ ❯❯❯ cd kickthemout/

~/kickthemout ❯❯❯ sudo -H pip3 install -r requirements.txt **NOTE: You will need a virtual environment to use pip**

~/kickthemout ❯❯❯ sudo python kickthemout.py
```
